# Colorful caves

- What do you get when geothermal hot springs carve a long channel beneath^[真下に] heavy snow compressed into ice? Ice caves! Inside, variations in ice thickness refract^[屈折させる] light differently, revealing a full spectrum of colors (thicker ice appears blue or green). But don't linger^[長居する] too long - ice caves can collapse at any time.
